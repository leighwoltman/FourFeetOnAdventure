<p><strong>W</strong>hile big Wyvis gets lots of attention, little Wyvis, it’s lower neighbour, is just sitting there, watching people walk by without getting much visits. We love hills that are less busy, especially on a bright and sunny day. Finally it’s getting a little warmer. We thought we were allowed to pass out of the 5 mile lock down zone around our house, but we found out afterwards that we were still supposed to stay in. But oh how nice it was to run loose for a day. Our last hill walk we were walking through the snow, and now shorts and t-shirts. The difference couldn’t be larger. Nature still looked a bit brown, but the cotton weed was out, and greens were starting to become more intense. </p>

<p>Wyvis must be about the closest munro to our house, and it’s little friend is therefore not far as well. It’s always fun to try to find our house from a hill, and recognize some land features around us. </p>

<p>We can't help but smiling. How nice to be out!</p>

<p>We had seen a good deal on some new shoes for Leigh, and decided to get them, even though we thought his boots looked like they would last another season. Good call, as following Leigh “on his heels” down, I saw that this was definitely the last trip of the shoes. Half of the sole was gone!</p>

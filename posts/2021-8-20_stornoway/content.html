<p><strong>S</strong>tornoway is the capital of Lewis, one of the Western Isles or Outer Hybridees. We were going to hang out for the weekend and bike to some lighthouses./></p>
 
<p>Also, it’s always so fun to pack our tandem bicycle, it reminds us of the good old days when we took a year off to bike around the American continent. /></p>
  
<p>First the ferry from Ullapool to Stornoway. We arrived late in Stornoway, and found a nice spot on a campground. We couldn’t remember the last time we actually stayed on a campground, but since we weren’t really going anywhere it would make it easy to leave the tent for the night and not have to pack and unpack for no reason./></p> 
  
<p>Saturday morning started somewhat sunny. Annette went for a run, after which we were going to bike to the lighthouse. Unfortunately, it started raining (not forecasted), and never stopped. However, this is part of the landscape as well, and we kept on reminding ourselves and each other that it wasn’t that bad. So, we kept at it, and managed to find the lighthouse through the low hanging clouds. Atmittandly, lighthouses are usually at the end of the end of the end of the last road, so somewhat hard to mis. /></p>
  
<p>On the way back there was a standing stone and a 6000 year old chambered cairn to visit, and by the time we got back to the tent it was somewhat dry. /></p>

<p>Sunday's weather proved to be a lot nicer (dry!). Nothing was open in Stornoway as is the habit on the Western Isles, but we found one bakery somewhere in the middle of a housing area that was open and got some nice treats to start our day. This time we were biking to another lighthouse, through the castle grounds. We saw our ferry coming in from the lighthouse, and then had to race to be at the ferry dock in time to take it back to Ullapool. No worries, no flat tire and we managed. A fun little trip. /></p>

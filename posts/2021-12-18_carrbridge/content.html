<p><strong>T</strong>he whole of Scotland was having an interesting phenomenon: a temperature inversion. It was freezing in the low areas, and apparently around +10 degrees Celsius on the tops of the hills, near 1000 metre. This caused the clouds to settle below the warmer air, and from space you could see what Scotland would look like with a massive sea level rise. </p>

<p>Saturday: We didn't feel like a hike to the top, but couldn't stay inside in our gray, cloudy homw base. We thought a bit higher ground should get us out of the clouds. And indeed, as soon as we drove up, we left the clouds behind and below us and got in a wintery sunny landscape. Higher might be warmer, but there is something to say for cold as well! We brought our bikes to bike around the countryside between Slochd and Carrbridge, where the humidity and cold had created a winter wonderland for us to explore. Have a look and enjoy this tranquil bike ride with us. </p>

<p>Sunday: We couldn’t resist to have a look at the temperature inversion from higher up. Annette was going for a climb in Coire an T-Sneachda, a climbing area in the Northern Cairngorms just an hour from our home. Even though the snow had melted off the rocks, the gully’s still had amazing quality snow in them, so that Annette and climbing partner John were able to do 2 routes. There was no wind, the air temperature was warm, and the sun still felt warm. Such amazing conditions are rare for winter climbs, and it was very enjoyable. Once above the clouds, it looked like all the other tops were islands in a sea of clouds. So amazing. 
Leigh opted for a walk from a car park nearby. The Cairngorms can be quite busy because the high car park is one of the highest around, making it easy to head high into the hills. It gives easy access to skiing and climbing and walking and anything else you might want to do. Just a tiny bit lower, there is another car park, from where you leave the crowds, and are on your own. Leigh was just above the clouds, and could see the clouds come in while enjoying amazing views to the higher Cairngorms. </p>

<p>Monday: work time. Oh no! The inversion was still ongoing, so Annette decided to take a bivi bag and a warm sleeping bag, and sleep the night on top of a nearby hill with friend Karen. We left in the dark and got back in the dark, the moon was fairly full, and it was cold! The snow had melted, but the frost had covered everything. Our whole world seemed to be covered in glittering diamonds. The world below us was still covered in clouds, and the other hills sticking out of the clouds were also covered in frost, lighted by a bright moon. Time for a nice cozy sleep in a very thick sleeping bag. </p>

<p>So many different ways to enjoy the temperature inversion! </p>

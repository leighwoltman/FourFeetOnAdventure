<p><strong>T</strong>he whole of Scotland was having an interesting phenomenon: a temperature inversion. Colder air was below, and warmer air was on top. This caused the clouds to settle below the warmer air, and from space you could see what Scotland would look like with a massive sea level rise. </p>

-add photo of inversion-

<p>It was freezing in the low areas, and apparently around +10 degrees Celsius on the tops of the hills, near 1000 metre. We didn't feel like a hike to the top, but settled for a bit higher ground than where we live (about sea level). And indeed, as soon as we drove up, we left the clouds behind and below us and got in a wintery sunny landscape. Higher might be warmer, but there is something to say for cold as well!</p>

<p>We brought our bikes to bike around the countryside between Slochd and Carrbridge, where the humidity and cold had created a winter wonderland for us to explore. Have a look and enjoy this tranquil bike ride with us. </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>nother trip to an unpronounceable hill. But never mind the name, it was full of pretty orchids! </p>

<p>We chose our way up through the bushes, with good views to the valley. </p>

<p>A typical day in Scotland, even though the sky doesn’t look too friendly, it actually wasn’t that cold on top.</p>

<p>We also don’t mind a little bit of refreshing rain. </p>

<p>Always when we see a little lochain, like the lake here, I feel like pitching my tent and staying. </p>

<p>Such a relaxing hike. We took a rest at the top of the hill. Luckily the previous rain was short and it had dried up already, so we could go for a little snooze in the soft moss. How peaceful it always is to be up in the hills. </p>

<p>More colours! I love this time of year when flowers are starting to bloom and colours are popping up everywhere. </p>

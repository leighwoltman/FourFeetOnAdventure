<p><strong>A</strong>aaaa, it's too early! 4.45. The alarm clock? What's up? Oh yes, we are going to Ljouwert (Leeuwarden). That's where he starts. The tour of all tours. Ridden for the first time on January 2, 1909. It is now February 11, 2012, and although it has been officially canceled, our Dutch soldiers have not been sweeping the ice for nothing, right? You can read on the internet where the weak spots are. We read this as: spectators please stay away, ice skaters, COME TO FRIESLAND! I am not an ice skater, but I am Dutch. We are talking about the tour of all tours and there is ice and I am in the Netherlands. For years I said that whatever I was doing, wherever in the world, I would come back if there was the possibility of skating it. It wasn't necessary I'm here now! Together with Bert, a climbing companion from Wageningen who was on TV as the scientist who can make the ice thicker. He got prime time broadcast time, yes, the Netherlands always goes crazy about this tour as soon as there is a little ice on the canals, but now there is a lot, the country has really gone mad!</p>

<p>Bert has seen a spot on Google Earth where you can park the car. It's probably not busy there we think. NOT TRUE, 7 o'clock in the morning THAT place is the place to be! Lots of people, TV crew. Yes! Like the famous saying in Frisian language, widely known in connection to this tour: IT GIET ON! (it goes ahead).'</p>

<p>Via Snits (Sneek) it goes to Drylts (Ijlst). Here Bert has done his famous research. There is one bridge less for klunen (Frisian word for walking with your skates off ice, usually to connect 2 ice fields). He proudly shows me where he injected CO2 cubes under the ice. Life filmed and broadcasted. We can all skate under this bridge now. My knees are grateful for the CO2 cubes, as klunen is hard on them. Argh, what a lot of low bridges. Klunen. Ouch, my knees, another low bridge. But ohh, we are enjoying this so much. The sun has now risen and the rest of Friesland is also coming onto the ice to skate around, as only Dutch people can do. We skate quietly to Sleat (Sloten). Around us there are many other people skating quietly with backpacks, we are all going in the same direction... (Sometimes we catch an eye and an acknowledgement passes between us, I know you are also attempting the tour..!) Slotermeer, how wide! Beautiful! Sleat is gezellig (fun in a homey way). People everywhere, old houses and hot chocolate for sale along the ice. The ice in Balk is said to be bad, but it's not too bad for us. We continue to the Luts, again, it is not as bad as we thought it might be. Sometimes I still can't believe we are really here doing this! Starum (Stavoren), 66 km from Ljouwert. Only 66 done yet. Ouch, my feet hurt. But the beautiful boats along the side of the ice make you forget that for a moment. Do we have to cross the IJsselmeer? No, we can go via a ditch along the dike. Hylpen (Hinderlopen), is this really a city? I blinked for a moment and oh well, we're out again.</p>

<p>We are going through very narrow canals, ditches realy. Kamikaze children suddenly decide to cross the ice, mothers with strollers skate steadily and in our way. Bert overtakes in a bend and I don't catch up until 20 minutes later. According to Bert we are going to Borkum. Borkum? Or Bolsward? No Workum or Warkum for the Frisians among us. It's not easy to talk about this with your jaws frozen shut by the cold temperatures that ensure the ice is there. By the way, chewing that cheese sandwich is no longer possible. Ouch my feet. Sit down for a moment. Just a moment. And have a sip of drink. “Are you just skating, or are you doing THE tour?” asks the woman next to me. I laugh, 'THE tour!' We get up again and stagger the first meters on painful feet before we get going again. Although we have just laughed at others, we are not doing any better in getting started again ourselves. On to Boalsert (Bolsward). And yes, Borkum is an island of Germany and is somewhat off the route. Another time. In the canoe perhaps? Woohoo, 100 km! We're almost there (hum). Halfway!</p>

<p>On to Harns (Harlingen). That's where the ferry goes, right? Yes, but not to Borkum. To Terschelling and Vlieland. But we're not going there. We are still on schedule, arriving at half past nine is the plan, that is doable. But then, we need to go klunen again. And not just to cross a bridge. No, 250 meters. Hum. Then clamber over the large lock gates. We continue. On to Frjentsjer (Franeker)! But oh dear, what is that? The sun is decreasing and the sun is already setting. Oops!</p>

<p>It really is a huge, very, very long way to Bartlehiem. Small canals with unswept cracks in the ice, there is no end to them. People in front and behind us with lights on their heads. Every now and then you hear the now well-known AAAAAA BOOM OUCH. A crack and someone's skate got in it. Sometimes it's us, sometimes it's them. Russian roulette. We have now expanded our group. The three of us are still moving. Ouch my feet. AAAAAA BOOM OU my knees. Grumbel tears Grumbel. Hungry! Ouch, my feet! We skate under a bridge and a woman shouts at us that it is only 10 km to Bartlehiem. “Good luck,” she shouts. Screaming at people on a bridge at -7 in the dark. That gives courage, The Tour is alive, we're in it, and still going!</p>

<p>Finally. We hardly dare to believe it and ask again. Yes, this is really Bartlehiem! Whooo! Time for food! Hot chocolate! Weight of those feet! After 10 minutes we continue again. To Dokkum. Thankfully, the ice to Dokkum is well swept. We deserved that after all those unvisible cracks earlier. People are cheering us on, it gives us courage. How fantastic. What a fantastic feeling that must have been for the skaters during the real tour, all those encouraging words. But all the Frisians we meet along the way are fantastic. That old man on that bridge. The 2 young people who instead of doing things that youngsters do, hang around at a section that needs klunen to help tired skaters as they stumble across the road on sore feet. We quickly get something to drink. It almost makes me emotional. Almost, because I'm actually just too tired to feel anything.</p>

<p>Back in Bartlehiem (Barthlehiem - Dokkum - Barthlehiem is an out and back section). Hi, we're back. How far. Real? Oh, that's not too bad. Suddenly we see a big light on the ice. It is 11:15 PM and quite cold. So there's just a man standing here warning us that we have to do klunen here. His wife and the rest of the village stand at the end of the ditch and help us. We think we are the last ones, because we saw no oncoming traffic on the way back from Dokkum. To Dokkum, lots of people, lights and tired 'hi, good luck!' shouts back and forth. Ouch, luckily the last klunen section is behind us now. On to the last part. The fatigue doesn't make it any better, and again we encounter unswept ice with cracks. AAAAA BOOM. Too tired for the AU. Yes, there he is in the distance. The Bonkevaart. Ljouwert (Leeuwarden). The eleventh city of the eleven city tour. It's 11:50 PM and we're there. We did it! Ouch, my feet!!!!!!! I stumble off the ice to take off my skates with the intention to never put them on again. At least not for a little while. Okay, we turn back once more for a photo.</p>

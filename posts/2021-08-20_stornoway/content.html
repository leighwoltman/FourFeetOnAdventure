<p><strong>S</strong>tornoway is the capital of Lewis, one of the Western Isles or Outer Hybridees. We enjoy going there as it is not too far, but requires taking a ferry which makes it feel like a big adventure! Bringing a car is a bit costly, but using the tandem bike is free. Yay for bike touring, if only for a few days. The late ferry on Friday works well with leaving work early, but arrives in Stornoway around 10 pm. </p>

<p>In august we camped on a campground close to town. We couldn’t remember the last time we actually stayed on a campground, but since we were planning an out and back trip on a day it would make it easy to leave the tent for the night and not have to pack and unpack. We were not the only ones going to the campground straight from the ferry, but they were still open and expecting guests. </p> 
  
<p>That saturday morning started somewhat sunny. Annette went for a run, after which we were going to bike to the lighthouse. Unfortunately, it started raining (not forecasted), and never stopped. We kept on reminding ourselves and each other that it wasn’t that bad and that it fit the landscape quite well.. So, we kept at it, and managed to find the lighthouse through the low hanging clouds. Atmittandly, lighthouses are usually at the end of the end of the end of the last road, so somewhat hard to mis, but still. </p>

<p> On the way back there was a standing stone and a 6000 year old chambered cairn to visit, and by the time we got back to the tent it became somewhat dry.</p>

<p>Sunday's weather proved to be a lot nicer (dry!). I couldn't resist getting up early for a swim in the ocean. The beaches are beautiful and so large! The western isles are very religious, so nothing was open in Stornoway on a Sunday. However, Leigh had done his google research and found one bakery somewhere in the middle of a housing area that was open and got some nice treats to start our day. </p>
 
<p> Although it was ferry day, we had time for another lighthouse. We cycled through the castle grounds, a wonderfull park/forest area connected to Stornoway. Around the lighthouse we found WWII defence bunkers. We saw our ferry coming in when we were at the lighthouse, and had to race back to be at the ferry dock in time to take it back to Ullapool. No worries, no flat tire, we managed. </p>

<p>”Every negative has it's positive'' was also very true on this trip, the rainy weather made for beautiful skies on the drive back home!></p>

<p>The second Stornoway adventure took place in October. The Friday ferry arrived even later, as it had to wait outside the harbour for a freight ship to depart. It was now already dark, and we still had an hour to bike in the rain to our yurt that we rented on airbnb for the weekend. Upon arrival we found out that the yurt was worth every paddle stroke. Not only did it look amazing, the host had put the heating on in advance. We settled quickly and were grateful to not be huddled in a wet tent. ></p> 

<p>Overnight the wind picked up to a proper storm. We were anticipating having to take the bus because of the storm, but we just managed to hold onto the bike to go around. The ferry was cancelled and fishing boats were staying in the harbour. We had some fresh eggs for breakfast that we picked from the chicken pen ourselves in the morning, and went about our day. ></p>

<p>The storm kept raging, and finally on Sunday morning we found out that the rain had stopped, and our yurt hadn’t blown away (though it sounded a couple of times like it would). It was time to explore the village where we were staying through a Sunday morning run. Beautiful views all the way. ></p>

<p>This post is going to end with a description of some art we saw. Stornoway, as being an island, has had many ships going under over the years. Perhaps none were so tragic as the story of Sheol Nan Iolaire. This ship left Scotland mainland on 31 December 1918 to arrive in the Stornoway harbour 1th January 1919, returning 280 men to their homes and families after having fought in WWI. Within sight of the harbour it hit a rock and went down resulting in the loss of 205 men. To commemorate this enormous tragic loss, there are several memorials for this event, among which one that I found so well suited and different that I thought I'd share. In the Stornoway harbour between piers 1 and 2 there is a beach drying up at low tide. An artist has made the ship come home to the harbour by hammering 280 wooden poles in the beach that form the real outline of the ship. Every time the water retreats after high tide the boat becomes visible, and it disappears again at high tide, back to its final resting place. Each of the 280 poles stand for 1 men. The poles are lit up at night, blue for the non-survivors, red for the survivors. </p>

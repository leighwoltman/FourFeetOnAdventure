<p><strong>T</strong>he road to this little hill was amazing, with snow in the trees and half frozen water. We thoroughly enjoyed the approach. </p>
<p>We had hoped the snow would be crusty so we could stand on it, but only the last little bit was thick enough, the rest was slow going knee deep (in places) wading. Beautiful though! </p>
<p>We made it to the halfway stone, a ginormous stone that looked as if dropped by aliens. Just a bit higher the snow became good to walk on, and the last bit to the top was quite pleasant. </p>
<p>We enjoyed the view for a while, and not too keen on having to re-trail another part decided to use our already made trail for the way back. A very enjoyable day. </p>

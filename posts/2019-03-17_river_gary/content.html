<p><strong>T</strong>here are a couple of river Garry’s around. Time to do the one South of us. It’s a bit of a drive, but oh well. We brought a bike to serve as a shuttle, and explored the river by car.</p>

<p>I’m starting to enjoy doing rivers, but sometimes the white water is growling so nasty at me that I get intimidated and walk around, all the while calming down my nerves. On this part there were waterfalls that were better to walk around, even Leigh did it. But of course he doesn’t mind also running my kayak through something that is just a little bit too much for me.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty stretch of river, that goes through quite deep canyons where people back in the days had to be quite inventive to make a railway. I often take the train to Edinburgh for work, but you miss the tracks and the train bridges. Now, from the water, we had all the time in the world to investigate, observe and enjoy. Well, not all the time in the world, as the moving water keeps you going, and if you don’t watch out, you’re in the middle of the next section of rapids. Adventures life, I love it!</p>

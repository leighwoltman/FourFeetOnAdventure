<p><strong>I</strong>t was a beautiful calm day. What better way to end it then to go for a little dip in the ocean at sunset? With water temperatures around 7 degrees Celcius we opted for the wet-suits. So nice and calm, with the sounds of sea birds around us, the feel of salt water on our faces. The feeling in our hands and feet slowly was slowly disappearing as the cold crept in, which meant unfortunately time to get out of this wonderful world and warm up.</p>

  
<p><strong>I</strong>t turned out to be one of those weekends with beautiful warm weather and almost no wind. This is always a bit dangerous on the west coast as the midges might be tempted to come out and feast on any uncovered skin they can find, but there is an easy remedy for that. Stay near the coast. Almost always there is a little breeze to be found to keep the midges away.</p>

<p>Destination for Saturday night was Lismore island, an island located in the great glen fault on the West coast. Well, actually not the island itself, we had spotted on google maps 2 little islands just off the coast of Lismore that were connected by a long beach, with the ocean at high tide leaving just the very top of this beach uncovered, the rest would be filled in from both sides. This seemed like an idyllic spot for a night of campling, so off we went.</p>

<p>It is always fun to go to this part of Scotland, it is so very different then the areas where we normally are. The rocks around Lismore are made of  limestone, which I still associate with Vietnam and have not seen further up north. There seem to be more trees in this area as well, but also more people, it's a busy area. More houses also means less easy access to wherever you want to go.</p>
  
<p>We found a spot to put in on google maps, that worked out quite well, also with a nearby overnight parking possibility for the car we were settled. The town of Benderloch had a nice sunny terrace, where we had a coffee and tea to recover from the drive. </p>
  
<p>The paddle over to our island was beautiful, and a first for me to see a sea eagle in Scotland. It was sitting on a rock, and it was so large that for the longest time I thought there was a human with a large head (head = beak of bird), but when the wings came out to start flying I had to quickly adjust my assumptions. Accompanied by some seals we made it to our island. </p>

<p>It was indeed wonderful. On the most northern of the two connected islands we found a rock formation, that, on closer inspection, could be climbed upon from the North East, providing an amazing panorama with Oban in the distance, the great glen behind us, and the straight of Mull opening up in front, guarded by 2 lighthouses that we were able to see from our tent as well. Just as we were getting ready to sleep, a sailing boat anchored right in front of us, providing idyllic photos, but also making it quite a bit more work to go for a quick pee. </p>

<p>After a good night of sleep, it was time to head back early because it was racing day in Oban. The eagle was not yet on his post, and so we paddled calmly back to the car, and drove the few more kms into Oban. Right in front of Oban was the island Kerrera, and this was the scene for a kayak race with surf skis and touring kayaks. And I had decided to join, while Leigh did some shopping and other chores in Oban. The route was easy, keep Kerrera on your right and stay out of the way of ferries. No problem. After a count down, off we went. I’ve never really raced before in a kayak, the principles seemed simple; paddle as hard as you can over as little as possible distance as you can. But I soon found out there is more to consider. Try to be smart with energy, keep hydrated (it was a warm sunny day) and get your skeg right. I have a skeg that I can adjust, and when it’s down my boat goes straighter but there is more water resistance, whereas when I have it up (not in the water) it is sometimes difficult to keep straight and I have to cover more distance because I wobble, which slows me down. But, there is less resistance, as the skeg isn’t there. While I was racing I must have adjusted my skeg about a million times (perhaps a bit exaggerated) and I tried to go around the rocks as tight as I could to not paddle any extra difference. However, sometimes it is better to be a bit further out because there is a stronger current there, or there is a back eddy near the rocks that slows you down, so even if there is a longer distance, sometimes the longest way is the shortest way, if you get what I mean.. No? I didn’t get it all the time either, but I managed to overtake a few people, and got overtaken by a few as well. I finished in a time I was happy with, and I always find it fun to go as fast as I can but that doesn't always makes sense when kayaking alone.</p>

<p>I expected to be a lot slower, so when I messaged Leigh that I was already finished, he was in line for a famous crab sandwich. Not a problem, I had some dry clothes with me and it was nice and sunny. When Leigh came back I had already accepted my first price in the women's touring category, the Oban lifeboat cup (proceeds of the race went to the lifeboat). I have to admit, that I also came in last in my category, apparently only men like to race with their kayaks. Oh well, I was happy with my time anyway, and had some nice chats with fellow paddlers. </p>

<p>The day had flown by, it was time for the long drive back to Inverness. In summer dress, short, T-shirt and sandals we arrived back home a couple of hours later to a 13 degrees cold and rainy Inverness, but with good memories from a fun weekend. </p>

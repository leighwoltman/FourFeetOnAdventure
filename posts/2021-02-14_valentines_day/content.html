<p><strong>D</strong>isclaimer: most likely this climb can not be found in any guide books. We named it ourselves, as we were officially together for 5 years. How better to celebrate than with an ice climb!</p>
<p>Driving back from Beinn Eighe the day before we spotted this iced over waterfall in a gully on the side of the road near Kinlochewe. It looked promising. We have had cold weather somewhat consistently since New Year, and the last week was especially cold with night temperatures where we live at sea level around -8 degrees Celsius. However, the wind would shift and it would become + 8 degrees Celsius the next day. Unfortunately, it’s not often that such low rivers are frozen over in Scotland, so we realized that if we wanted to climb it, it would be an early rise and this was the day. </p>
<p>And that’s why we found ourselves at the start of an icy river. It would be the first real ice climb of the season, with gear and all. We were able to scramble sections on crampons and axes, but needed to tie into our rope for other sections. It was beautifully frozen for most of it, until we got to the top where water poured on top of the ice and streamed into the sleeve of our rain jackets when we placed the axe in the ice. Lucky this steep part had a tree next to it, which made for a good and safe gear placement. I named this part of the climb “the shower”. Generally, the ice screws worked wonderfully well everywhere and it was an amazing ice climbing adventure. </p>
